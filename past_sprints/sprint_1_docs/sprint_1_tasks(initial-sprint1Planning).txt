Sprint 1 Tasks (Prioritized)

1. Develop black box tests and prepare white box tests
	(note: most of our old white box tests should still work. Only those for the new class will need to be created from scratch)
2. Write a collage builder class that can build in the shape of letters.
3. Integrate new collage builder into the old (reused) project.
	(note: we will leave conformance to changed UI requirements for a later sprint)
4. Prepare white box tests for collage builder class
5. Design animated loading icon.
