code post checklist:

1. PULL before you PUSH. Always!
2. ensure that you have your PP photo prepared. commit this AT THE SAME TIME AS CODE.
3. WRITE DOWN your SHAs! You will report this during the scrum meeting.
4. ONLY commit the files that you have modified... NOT the whole project.
5. If something DOESNT WORK FULLY, DONT POST IT. I don't want half-assed code in the repo.


note for pulling code:

1. DO NOT pull straight into your project folder. COPY the files here into their respective
	locations in your workspace. This will fix all the config issues.
